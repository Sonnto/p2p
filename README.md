# Future Developments
- Implement Backend Design to EJS/CSS : https://github.com/beartisan/pixelate-backend.git
- Users can create an account in the future
- Improve on app design and styling
- instructions.pdf includes pixelated image, + more pages
- Mobile responsive application 
- Incorporate Colors API for “closest LEGO colour”
- Segment API endpoint for Radio to fetch segment inspos
- Store and Pixelate larger sized images
- Find more efficient way of storing images
- Administrator(s) should be able to edit current accounts
- Pixelated image should output image with LEGO-bricks instead of square pixels
